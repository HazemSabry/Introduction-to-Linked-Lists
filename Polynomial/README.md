# Polynomial Calculator

The Polynomial Calculator is a Java program that allows you to perform various operations on polynomials. It provides functionalities to set, print, add, subtract, multiply, evaluate, and clear polynomials. This calculator is designed to handle polynomials represented as linked lists.

## Features

1. **Set Polynomial:** You can set a polynomial by providing its name (A, B, or C) and its terms in the form of coefficients and exponents. The terms can be entered as a 1D array or a 2D array.

2. **Print Polynomial:** You can print a polynomial by specifying its name (A, B, C, or R). The polynomial will be displayed in a human-readable format, like "27x^2+x-1".

3. **Add Polynomials:** You can add two polynomials and store the result in the result polynomial (R). The result can be printed afterward.

4. **Subtract Polynomials:** You can subtract one polynomial from another and store the result in the result polynomial (R). The result can be printed afterward.

5. **Multiply Polynomials:** You can multiply two polynomials and store the result in the result polynomial (R). The result can be printed afterward.

6. **Evaluate Polynomial:** You can evaluate a polynomial by providing its name (A, B, or C) and a constant value. The calculator will return the value of the polynomial for the given constant.

7. **Clear Polynomial:** You can clear a polynomial by specifying its name (A, B, or C). After clearing, the polynomial will be empty.

## Usage

1. **Setting Polynomials:**

   To set a polynomial, use the "set" command followed by the polynomial's name (A, B, or C) and the polynomial terms. You can input terms as either a 1D array or a 2D array.

   Example 1 (1D array):

   ```
   set
   A
   [27,1,-1]
   ```

   Example 2 (2D array):

   ```
   set
   B
   [[27,1],[-1,0]]
   ```

2. **Printing Polynomials:**

   To print a polynomial, use the "print" command followed by the polynomial's name (A, B, C, or R).

   Example:

   ```
   print
   R
   ```

3. **Adding, Subtracting, or Multiplying Polynomials:**

   To perform mathematical operations on polynomials (addition, subtraction, multiplication), use the respective operation command (add, sub, mult) followed by the names of the polynomials involved (poly1 and poly2).

   Example (Addition):

   ```
   add
   A
   B
   ```

4. **Evaluating Polynomials:**

   To evaluate a polynomial for a given constant value, use the "eval" command followed by the polynomial's name and the constant value.

   Example:

   ```
   eval
   C
   3
   ```

5. **Clearing Polynomials:**

   To clear a polynomial, use the "clear" command followed by the polynomial's name.

   Example:

   ```
   clear
   A
   ```

## Implementation

- The program is implemented using linked lists for efficient polynomial manipulation.
- It supports multiple polynomial storage (A, B, C) and a result polynomial (R).

## Getting Started

1. Compile the code: `javac Polynomial.java`
2. Run the program: `java Polynomial`
