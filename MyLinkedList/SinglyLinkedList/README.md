## Introduction

This program implements a singly linked list (`SLinkedList`) and supports various operations, such as adding elements, clearing the list, checking if it's empty, setting values at specific indexes, and more. It also allows you to perform operations on sublists of the main list.

## Usage

The program takes user input to perform operations on the linked list. You can enter commands and values to manipulate the list. The available operations are described in the [Supported Operations](#supported-operations) section.

## Supported Operations

The following operations are supported:

- `add`: Add an element to the end of the list.
- `addToIndex`: Add an element at a specified index.
- `isEmpty`: Check if the list is empty.
- `set`: Set the value of an element at a specified index.
- `get`: Retrieve the value at a specified index.
- `size`: Get the size of the list.
- `contains`: Check if the list contains a specific element.
- `sublist`: Get a sublist from a specified range of indices.
- `clear`: Remove all elements from the list.
- `remove`: Remove an element at a specified index.

## Examples

Here are some example commands that you can use to interact with the linked list:

- Add an element to the end of the list: `add <element>`
- Add an element at a specific index: `addToIndex <index> <element>`
- Check if the list is empty: `isEmpty`
- Set the value at a specific index: `set <index> <element>`
- Retrieve the value at a specific index: `get <index>`
- Get the size of the list: `size`
- Check if the list contains a specific element: `contains <element>`
- Get a sublist: `sublist <fromIndex> <toIndex>`
- Remove all elements from the list: `clear`
- Remove an element at a specific index: `remove <index>`
